## üîê Authentication

This API uses JWT for authentication. To access protected endpoints, you need to include the access token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

Alternatively, you can use the secure cookie-based authentication provided by the `CookieTokenObtainPairView`.

## üì¶ Data Models

The main data models in this project are:

*   **`CustomUser`**: Extends the default Django User model with roles (`master_admin`, `dept_admin`, `staff`).
*   **`Room`**: Represents a room in the hospital with details like room number, bed number, and a generated QR code.
*   **`Complaint`**: The core model for storing complaint details, including status, priority, and assigned department/staff.
*   **`ComplaintImage`**: Stores images associated with a complaint.
*   **`Department`**: Represents a hospital department.
*   **`Issue_Category`**: Defines categories for complaints, linked to departments.

## üß™ Testing

Currently, there are no automated tests in this project. It is recommended to add unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the API. You can use Django's built-in `TestCase` or other testing frameworks like `pytest`.

To run tests, you would typically use the following command:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
